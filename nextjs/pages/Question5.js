            <h3>When it comes to looking for a solution for hosting your Next.js site, what are some of the common things
you would value as the Engineering Manager for:
1. A mom and pop business?
2. An NFT?
3. A Marketing Page for a large corporation like Nintendo? </h3>   

Okay, this one is tricky, not sure if I understand it fully, but personally, I would suggest Nintendo, their Nintendo Switch e-Shop is powered by next.js. I don't have much knowledge of NFT so I cannot give an accurate answer unless I study it.
