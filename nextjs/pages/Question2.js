            <h3>a. In your next role, what are you looking to learn or do more of?</h3>
            <h4> Answer: In my next role, I am looking to learn 3 things</h4>
            1. First and foremost, learn more sales skills <br></br>
            2. Learn more leadership skills over time, as in 5 years' time I envision myself working in a leadership role.<br></br>
            3. In my career, I have always worked as an independent contractor, and now I would like to learn about organizational culture by becoming a full-time employee.
            <h4>In my next role, I am looking to do 3 things more of </h4>
            1. Product evangelism: The study says clients are 130% more likely to purchase from a brand after reading content from that brand. This number is powerful. I will heavily emphasize creating written content that delivers accurate, concise, and helpful information to prospects evaluating/using vercel products so they can make informed decisions.<br></br>
            2. Being Proactive: Once I become familiar with the work, the next step for me is to go the extra mile. I will be proactive in attending meetings and learning about products and building new skills in order to help my team. <br></br>
            3. Troubleshooting : When a problem shows up, I will start looking for a solution myself, and if its appropriate, try and fix the issue without being prompted.
            <h3>b. Which (non-Vercel) technical or sales article, guide or lightning talk left the biggest positive
impression on you? Why? (and please provide the link)</h3>

In recent times, " Preparing for a Future Pandemic with Artificial Intelligence " published by pacific northwest national laboratory has left the biggest positive impression on me. Why? Because it gives me hope that when the next pandemic strikes our world, humanity, especially in underprivileged places, will be much more prepared than it was this time. To understand it better there is some personal backstory I must share with you. The deadliest variant of coronavirus "the delta variant ", was first found in India last year. By the time people became aware of the existence of this new deadly variant, it had already spread to every nook and cranny. There is still no data available to know exactly how many people lost their lives in that devastating delta variant caused wave, but we know that cemeteries had run out of spaces, crematoriums malfunctioned, and bodies were dumped in ditches and rivers, all of these are well documented and are in the public domain. The memories of helpless people running around, trying to get their hands on an oxygen cylinder â€” even an empty one. Little Children pleading with overworked hospital staff to somehow arrange a critical care bed for their mom and dad will haunt me for the rest of my life. My family didn't remain untouched either, this variant killed my 10 relatives in a span of two weeks last summer. Back then I really wished that small places like ours had advanced AI technologies that could easily track the spread of this virus, the emergence of the new variant, identify the high-risk patients, and monitor and predict the next phase of infection in real-time, a lot of innocent lives could have been saved. So far advanced AI technology is accessible only to a privileged few, developing places like ours still see AI as rocket science and avoid it altogether because of cost concerns. I am convinced that things are going to change, in near future, universal access to Artificial Intelligence Technology can be as simple as electricity access to remote places. <br></br>
